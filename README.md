# üè• Patient Portal App

The Patient Portal Backend provides an API for patients to access and view their medical reports. It includes support for filtering reports by patient name, data and a in-mem data storage


API's and Backend Provide: 

Report Management: CRUD operations for patient reports
Filtering: Filter reports by patient name, report type, and date
Pagination: Efficient handling of large datasets
Caching: Performance optimization via in-memory caching


Frontend is Organized As: 

Dashboard Overview: View key statistics about reports and recent patient data
Report Management: Browse, filter, and sort medical reports
Detailed Reports: View information about patient reports
Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile

### üßº Clean Up

To remove **all containers, images, volumes, and networks**:
```bash
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

To stop the app without deleting resources:
```bash
docker compose down
```

If you need to reseed the database you need to run the command again

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### üìù Notes

- The frontend expects the backend API at `http://localhost:3001/api/v1`, configured through `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
- Backend uses an in-memory database. Restarting the container clears all data.
